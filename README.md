**My Uncle's Army Days** is one of the projects I enjoyed doing the most. This game is a retro FPS, inspired by Doom, with programming, game, and level design entirely done by me. It features:

- **8 different weapons**
- **11 unique enemies**

The game consists of a **DEMO map**, which is divided into **3 sections**:

1. **Blue Key Section**
2. **Orange Key Section**
3. **Red Key Section**

Each section requires the player to collect a key to progress. Unlike the classic Doom, this game introduces:

- **Unique bosses and challenges** in every section
- Levels like the "hell section" (filled with enemies) and mazes
